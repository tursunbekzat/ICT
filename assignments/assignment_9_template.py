The objective of this assignment is to print the expected output.
You can find it in the instruction folder.
List of installed and authorized packages :
    - numpy
    - scikit-learn (import sklearn)
You cannot use other packages than the listed ones (except built-in default package in python).
You can write you code after this comment :
'''

#Your code here:
import numpy as np
import sklearn.linear_model as skmod

feature = [int(i) for i in input1.split(',')]
label = [i for i in input2.split(',')]
feature_predict = [int(i) for i in input3.split(',')]






#Use this code for your output where:
#        - feature_predict is the list of features given for prediction (=input3)
#        - predictions is the list of predictions made by your model with the feature_predict.
#        - Predictions_proba is the list a probability of each classes for each predictions (shape looks like [[0.2, 0.8], [0.5, 0.5], [0.6, 0.4]â€¦..], it has two items per predictions, we take the maximum one).
 
for i in range(len(predictions)):
    print("For a feature egal to {}, the most probable result is {} with a probability of {:.2f}.".format(feature_predict[i], predictions[i], max(predictions_proba[i])))
